          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="linkPara">
            <b>Hello,</b> and welcome to my website. It's not the flashiest, but this is a place where I 
            keep examples and demonstrations of my previous and current work.
          </p>
          <p class="linkPara">
            I love combining various pieces of technology to make new ideas, experiences and things.
            
            My interests centre around music, audio, visual arts and technology, and how they can
            be combined. 
          </p>

          
          
          <p class="linkPara">
            On the audio side of things - I've worked in Live Sound, Sound Recording, Sound Engineering and play Bass guitar, Synthesisers and Keyboards. I also repair and modify audio equipment and can make custom electronics. 
          </p>
            
            <p class="linkPara">
            On the techy/programming/visual side of things I've worked in Web Development (CSS, Java, HTML), Game Engines (Unity, C#, Unreal, C++), Animation (Blender, TouchDesigner, Notch) 3D Modelling (Blender, 3DS Max, Sketchup), Audio-Visual Design and Audio Programming (C++, MaxMSP). 
            I have worked with technologies including Projection Mapping, Ultra-Wide-Band, Motion Capture, BLE Beacons, RFID, IR Sensors, Virtual-Reality, Augmented Reality, Depth,-Sensing Cameras, 
            Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Bela Platform, Analogue Electronics, Android, iOS, PC and Mac. 
          </p>

            <p class="linkPara">
            I am also an experienced AV engineer, with a solid understanding of networking, audio, video, lighting and power systems. I have designed systems for large scale events, museums, theatres, offices and corporate auditoriums.
          </p>

           <p class="linkPara">
            I am always open to conversations and collaborations, so please feel free to get in touch at: projectsinsound@gmail.com

          <p class="smalltext">
            Working for Pixel Artworks, I was the Technology Lead and System Designer for this brand activation for the New Adidas football boots.
            Competitors were given a pair of boots and told to compete in three challenges: a sprint, a dribbling challenge and a reaction test.
            Visitors were tracked through the space using RFID wristbands, and the challenges were timed using Terrabee Evo sensors.

            This work was done to highlight the prospective designs of theatres
            to clients, whilst I was working for a theatre design consultancy.
            For this work I used Autodesk 3DS Max to bring architectural
            drawings from AutoCAD and Sketchup into Unity, in order to assess
            the sight lines from every seat in the house, before a brick had
            been layed. Please contact me if you would like more details or
            information. Unfortunately the frame rate has been greatly reduced by the screen recorder I used.

            This project was a creative project led by the Intsitute of Digital Fashion, comissioned by The Barbican for the Our Time on Earth Exhbition.
            I was responsible for sound design, composition, show control, motion capture integration and some of the visual elements. In collaboration with visual artists Cattytay, Neal Coghlan and Hanzo Schwarz.

            On this project I was lucky to work with the incredible Ruth and Bruno who make up Gibson Martelli. 
            Through the use of pixel streaming, live link, web sockets, backpack PCs, Vive VR headsets and art-net lighting protocol we
            were able to produce a piece of work that could be enjoyed both in physical, augmented and virtual reality.

          <p class="smalltext">
           This is a test shoot that I worked on for target3D with Virtual Production specialists Final Pixel. Using motion capture, we created live interaction between the real and unreal worlds.
            As Technology Solutions Engineer I was responsible for the motion capture, lighting and audio systems for the project.
            This involved sending Motion Capture data into Unreal via LiveLink, as well as lighting control data via ArtNet.

          <p class="smalltext">
           This project involoved implementing gesture control for a presenter on a virtual production stage. 
           I used TouchDesigner to send positional data of the presenter's hands to Unreal via OSC messages, and wrote blueprints to trigger events based on this information.
           I also implemented communication with QLab and d+b Soundscape with Unreal.

            This project implements the behaviours of an ecosystem into the

          <p class="smalltext">
            Here are some examples of some of my recent experiements using TouchDesigner to replicate the movements of the planets of our solar system.
            I built a max for live device that recieves information from TouchDesigner to Abkleton in order to create generative sound in real time. 
            The audio itself is created using VCV rack, a software absed modular synthesis system.
            The movememt of the planets is sumlated using the python library "solar system".

          <h5>Position Tracking, Ultra Wideband and Spatial Audio</h5>

          <p class="smalltext">
            Real-time position tracking of people in a space is achieved by
            using Ultra Wideband Technology with the Decawave DWM-1001
            Development Boards. These boards output x, y, z co-ordinates to a
            raspberry pi, which acts as a server, and sends positional updates
            over wi-fi to an android smartphone, using MQTT messaging protocol.
            These positional updates are used within a Unity app on the
            smartphone to deliver a position-based spatial audio experience to
            the listener. This technology could be used for audio guides, sonic
            treasure hunts, immersive theatre or interactive musical
            performance. I plan to continue the development of this technology
            in order for a position-tracked audience to directly manipulate
            soundscapes as they move around a space.

            I'm planning on turning Birdsongs into a 3D game, and have been working on making some low-poly 3D assets for the game. 
            I'll be honest, I did get a bit distracted animating my player character to do a silly dance, but here's a little teaser of some of my progress.

            I am in the process of restoring an old analogue mixing desk from 1984. I bought it very cheap on eBay as it didn't come with a power supply.
            I have built my own small power supply which has allowed me to start restoring each module of the mixing desk one at a time. 
            Once I have restored all functionality to each of the individual modules I will reassemble the desk and build a power supply with high enough current to power the whole desk.
            Here is a short video of me testing the functionality of one of the input channel strips.

            <h5>Modular Synth Construction</h5>
              <p class="smalltext">
            After finding an old hobbyist electronics type book in a charity shop, I decided to start building my own modular synthesiser.
               So far I have built an oscillator, a VCA, an ADSR and a VCF. The Synthesiser can be controlled by MIDI, using a Bela computer, which is a Raspberry Pi like device with an audio focus.
                I have written a script in C++ that takes in MIDI messages to Bela via the USB port and emits analogue control voltages which are sent to the synthesiser. 
                Video to come soon.
          </p>
              <br />

          <h4>Custom User Interfaces</h4>
          <p class="smalltext">
            I have a Dave Smith Instruments Prophet Rev2, which is a really fun digitally controlled analogue synthesiser. 
            Its really fun to mess around with the gated sequencer in the sysnthesiser, but its quite fiddly using the synthesiser's user interface.
            I decided to make a patch in Max MSP that would control the parameters of the synthesiser in a much more intuitive manner.
            My next step for this project is to try and build this interface in hardware, using arduinos to convert analogue signals from the interface into digital messages.
