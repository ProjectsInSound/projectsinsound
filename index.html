          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello, my name is Graham, and hopefully if you're reading this you
            are considering my application for Founders and Coders. Before I
            tell you about why I'm applying, I'd like to just tell you a bit
            about myself...
          </p>
          <p>
            I am 28, originally from Reading but have lived in London for
            roughly two and a half years. When I was 22, i went to University to
            study Music. My interests are music, cooking, cycling and meeting up
            with friends (back when that was allowed).
          </p>
          <p>
            I've always loved technology and music, which is why for this
            website I decided to build a synthesiser. Please check it out before
            you go, I spent ages on it.
          </p>
          <h2>Why I'm Applying</h2>

          <p>
            In short: Because I want to become a web developer, and because
            Founders and Coders sounds like a great place to do that. A friend
            of mine did the course quite a few years ago, and speaking to them
            has made me really admire the work of the organisation.
          </p>
          <p>
            I grew up with friends from a diverse range of backgrounds, but then
            going to University to study music, and having worked in the arts
            sector for the last few years, I am aware how my privilege has
            enabled me to do this. I;ve also seen how disproportionately people
            with my same background are represented in these areas, and the
            detrimental effects that has. I believe the internet is the greatest
            resource we have for changing this, because access to the internet
            can break down so many of the barriers to information, experience
            and knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've always been a geek, and I've always spent ages on computers,
            mostly making or listening to music. From listening to electronic
            music, I've gotten into synthesisers, and from there I've gotten
            into programming using Max MSP. I've also played around with trying
            to make music in Unity, so have learnt some bits of C#. Through
            doing this, I've found that I really enjoy sitting down and solving
            technical problems, which is how I approached building this
            synthesiser. Once I found out about the WebAudio API, I had to think
            about what I wanted to make, and then solve every problem to get
            there.
          </p>
          <p>
            My interest in programming has been steadily growing over the last
            few years, but since the pandemic hit I have found out about an
            open-source programme called VCV Rack, and I think it's the coolest
            thing ever. It's basically a software recreation of lots of modular
            synthesisers, and there is a whole community of people who
            contribute their own designs for free. There is also a tonne of
            people doing free tutorials on Youtube. It's written in C++, and
            it's not hosted on the web, but I think that it's amazing that with
            an internet connection and a free piece of software you can
            synthesise sounds that would previously need thousands of pounds
            worth of hardware. The reason why I'm talking about this is because
            finding out about that software, and listening to interviews of its
            creator, has made me decide to switch lanes and commit to trying to
            become a web developer. Although there's issues around artists
            getting paid, I think it's great how things like mixcloud,
            soundcloud, spotify, shazam and fiverr have opened up music. And how
            right now I'm typing this into google docs without having to pay for
            microsoft word. I'm not sure exactly what I want to do for work, but
            I'd love to work somewhere that opens up doors to cool things, and I
            think being a web developer is the best way of doing that.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm a sociable person, and I think I'm pretty open-minded and
            comfortable in the company of all sorts of people. I think that it
            is much easier to learn and solve problems as a team, and if i were
            to be offered a place on the course, I would be hoping to make a lot
            of new friends and work with all of the people on the course to
            succeed together. Through making music, I've worked with loads of
            people on loads of different collaborative projects and really
            enjoyed it, and it would be great to be able to bring that spirit to
            Founders and Coders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks for reading, I hope I didn't go on too long.
